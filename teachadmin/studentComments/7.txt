To improve in this area even further, I recommend her to study the vocabulary in addition to the phrases from the Fluency Time section.


Family & Friends:

To improve even further in this area, she should review the vocabulary and grammar covered in the Super Study Sheet.

Even if she still have room for growth, Jenna is doing very well.
