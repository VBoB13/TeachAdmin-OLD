To improve in this area even further, I recommend him to study the vocabulary in addition to the phrases from the Fluency Time section.


Family & Friends:
	Evan scored 57.5 points in the Family and Friends section, which is amazing!
To improve even further in this area, he should review the vocabulary and grammar covered in the Super Study Sheet.
